# wunderground_iot_project
Low Power ESP32 based solution as a wunderground weather station module.

The purpose of this project is to develop a low power, portable weather station module, powered by solar energy. This module will be registered in the “WheatherUnderground” platform (https://www.wunderground.com/pws/overview) where the queried data can be observed. The module is based on a ESP32 platform, interfaced with a BME280 sensor capable of monitoring the environmental temperature, humidity and atmospheric pressure. Additionally, if needed, this data will also be able to be sent through the Firebase service for better visibility or debugging purposes.
